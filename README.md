# ETL Project: Victoria Traffic Analysis

## Overview:

The main focus of this project is to extract data from available sources and perform an ETL route on the extracted data. For this project we chose to analyse the behaviour of vehicle traffic in the state of Victoria. The three main focus areas for this project are,
    •	The traffic volume as a whole for Victoria
    •	The hourly traffic volume for Victoria
    •	Homogenous Traffic Flow
What we want to achieve through this analysis is, to outline the freeways and other linked roads to them with highest traffic volume. Furthermore, we will be outlining the highest traffic volume as per the time of the day. With the analysis of homogenous traffic flow, we will be creating a heat map with traffic flowing in and out of Victoria.
